This project is a fork the JS version of Oregon Trail from https://github.com/chairmanmow/synchro_trail and adapted for Discord play.

Players can start a game by sending the message `oregontime`.


## Basic Usage

This sample bot listens for the word "hello" to be said to it -- either as a direct mention ("@bot hello") or an indirect mention ("hello @bot") or a direct message (a private message inside Slack between the user and the bot).

The Botkit constructor returns a `controller` object. By attaching event handlers
to the controller object, developers can specify what their bot should look for and respond to,
including keywords, patterns and various [messaging and status events](#responding-to-events).
These event handlers can be thought of metaphorically as skills or features the robot brain has -- each event handler defines a new "When a human say THIS the bot does THAT."

The `controller` object is then used to `spawn()` bot instances that represent
a specific bot identity and connection to Slack. Once spawned and connected to
the API, the bot user will appear online in Slack, and can then be used to
send messages and conduct conversations with users. They are called into action by the `controller` when firing event handlers.
